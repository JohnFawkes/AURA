# Configuration

aura uses a `config.yaml` file for configuration. You can setup the configuration file during the onboarding process. However, if you would like, below are the instructions for creating and modifying the `config.yaml` file.

1. **Create the `config.yaml` File**:

    - You can create a new file named `config.yaml` in the root directory of your aura installation.

2. **Edit the `config.yaml` File**:
    - Open the `config.yaml` file in a text editor of your choice.
    - Modify the configuration settings according to your needs.
3. **Place the `config.yaml` File**:
    - Place your configuration file in the `/config` directory on your Docker container.

# Configuration Options

## Authentication

-   **Example**:

```yaml
Auth:
    Enable: true
    Password: $argon2id$v=19$m=16,t=2,p=1$Wlp5RGd4dTNkdmVGVDRkMg$2QEi6FDa4BWDxuGrzhjuVw
```

While this password authentication method is effective, it is important to keep your password secure and not share it with others. For enhanced security, consider using solutions like [Authentik](https://goauthentik.io/) or [Authelia](https://www.authelia.com/).

### Enable

-   **Default**: `false`
-   **Options**: `true` or `false`
-   **Description**: Whether to enable authentication.
-   **Details**: If set to `true`, you will be required to authenticate before accessing the application.

### Password

-   **Default**: `null`
-   **Options**: Any valid Argon2id hash
-   **Description**: The password hash used to authenticate user.
-   **Details**: This password is used to authenticate user when they log in to the application. It is recommended to use a strong, unique password for this purpose. You can generate a new Argon2id hash using tools like [Argon2 Online](https://argon2.online/). You can use the default settings.

## Logging

-   **Example**:

```yaml
Logging:
    Level: DEBUG
```

### Level

-   **Default**: `TRACE`
-   **Options**: `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`
-   **Description**: The logging level for aura.
-   **Details**:
    -   `TRACE`: Most detailed logging, useful for debugging.
    -   `DEBUG`: Less detailed than TRACE, but still provides useful information for debugging.
    -   `INFO`: General information about the application's operation.
    -   `WARN`: Indicates potential issues that are not necessarily errors.
    -   `ERROR`: Indicates errors that occur during the application's operation.
-   **Note**: The logging level can be adjusted based on your needs. For production environments, it is recommended to use `INFO` or `WARN` to reduce log verbosity. If you run into issues, you can temporarily set it to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` for more detailed logs.

    APIKey: your_mediux_api_key_here
    DownloadQuality: optimized
```

### APIKey

-   **Description**: The API key for Mediux.
-   **Details**: This option specifies the API key required to access Mediux's API. This can be obtained by creating an account on [Mediux](https://mediux.io/) and generating an API key in your account settings.

## Images

-   **Example**:

```yaml
Images:
    CacheImages:
        Enabled: false
    SaveImageLocally:
        Enabled: false
        Path: ""
```

## CacheImages.Enabled

-   **Default**: `false`
-   **Options**: `true` or `false`
-   **Description**: Whether to cache images locally.
-   **Details**: If set to `true`, aura will cache images to reduce load times and improve performance. This is particularly useful for frequently accessed images.Keep in mind that enabling this option will increase disk space usage as images will be stored locally.

## SaveImageLocally.Enabled

-   **Default:** `false`
-   **Options:** `true` or `false`
-   **Description:** Whether to save images locally.
-   **Details:**
    -   If `true`, images are saved in the same directory as the Media Server content.
    -   If `false`, images are updated on the Media Server but not saved next to the content.
    -   For **Emby** or **Jellyfin**, this option is ignored (handled by the server).
    -   For **Plex**, this option determines if images are saved next to content.

## SaveImageLocally.Path

-   **Default:** `""` (empty string)
-   **Options:** Any valid file path
-   **Description:** The path where images should be saved if `SaveImageLocally.Enabled` is `true`.
-   **Details:**
    -   If set to a valid path, images will be saved to that directory.
    -   If left empty, images will be saved next to the media content.
    -   Ensure the specified path is writable by the application.

## Labels and Tags

Aura supports adding and removing labels (tags) on Plex items after processing. This is useful for organizing your media library, marking items for automation, or integrating with other tools.

-   **Example**:

```yaml
LabelsAndTags:
    Applications:
        - Application: Plex
          Enabled: true
          Add:
              - "Overlay"
              - "4K"
          Remove:
              - "OldLabel"
```

### Applications

-   **Description**:  
    An array of label/tag configuration blocks, one per supported application (currently only Plex is supported).
-   **Fields**:
    -   `Application`: The name of the application (e.g., `Plex`).
    -   `Enabled`: Set to `true` to enable label/tag management for this application.
    -   `Add`: A list of labels/tags to add to items after processing.
    -   `Remove`: A list of labels/tags to remove from items after processing.

#### Example Use Case

If you want Aura to add the labels `Overlay` and `4K` to your Plex items, and remove the label `OldLabel`, your config would look like:

```yaml
LabelsAndTags:
    Applications:
        - Application: Plex
          Enabled: true
          Add:
              - "Overlay"
              - "4K"
          Remove:
              - "OldLabel"
```

#### Notes

-   You can leave `Add` or `Remove` empty if you only want to add or only want to remove labels.
-   Only applications with `Enabled: true` will be processed.
-   This structure is extensible for future support of other applications (such as Sonarr or Radarr).
